# ToDoList
A To-Do List is a timeless method for organizing tasks and responsibilities in a structured manner. It serves as a simple yet effective system for planning and tracking daily, weekly, or long-term goals.
A to-do list is a vital tool for managing tasks, enhancing productivity, and maintaining organization. When developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a robust and user-friendly solution that seamlessly integrates functionality with professional design. The foundation of the project is built on HTML, which structures the content into task input fields, action buttons, and dynamic task lists. This ensures a logical and accessible layout that forms the backbone of the application.

CSS is utilized to refine the visual appeal, employing modern techniques such as Flexbox and Grid for a responsive and adaptable interface. The careful selection of typography, including the use of the classic Times New Roman font, lends a professional and timeless aesthetic. Other design elements, such as color schemes and hover effects, are incorporated to enhance usability while maintaining a polished appearance.

JavaScript brings the application to life by enabling dynamic interactions. Features such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks, alongside localStorage for data persistence, allow users to manage tasks efficiently without losing progress. Advanced techniques, including event delegation and DOM manipulation, ensure smooth functionality and scalability.

To uphold professionalism, the project adheres to best coding practices, including modular code organization and detailed documentation. Accessibility is prioritized, ensuring compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

This to-do list exemplifies the seamless integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an elegant, functional, and professionally designed task management tool.
